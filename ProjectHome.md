**WebSlayer** is a tool designed for brute forcing Web Applications, it can be used for finding  resources not linked (directories, servlets, scripts,files, etc), brute force GET and POST parameters, bruteforce Forms parameters (User/Password), Fuzzing, etc. The tools has a payload generator and an easy and powerful results analyzer.


You can perform attacks like:

  * Predictable resource locator, recursion supported (Discovery)

  * Login forms brute force

  * Session brute force

  * Parameter brute force

  * Parameter fuzzing  and injection (XSS, SQL)

  * Basic and Ntml authentication brute forcing

**Features**:

  * Recursion
  * Encodings: 15 encodings supported
  * Authentication: supports Ntml and Basic
  * Multiple payloads: you can use 2 payloads in different parts
  * Proxy support (authentication supported)
  * For predictable resource location it has: Recursion, common extensions, non standard code detection
  * Multiple filters for improving the performance and for producing cleaner results
  * Live filters
  * Multithreads
  * Session saving
  * Integrated browser (webKit)
  * Time delay between requests
  * Attack balancing across multiple proxies


  * Predefined dictionaries for predictable resource location, based on known servers (Thanks to Dark Raver, www.open-labs.org)
